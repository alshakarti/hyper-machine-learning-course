# Group Assignment Series: Titanic Survival Prediction Using Decision Trees

## Overview

In this project, you and your group will develop a machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. You will work together to download the dataset, perform data cleaning and feature engineering, explore and visualize the data, build and optimize a decision tree classifier, and finally present your findings in a comprehensive report and presentation.

**Dataset:**  
[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
(Alternatively, you may choose another Kaggle dataset with real-life implications.)

## Assignment 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

**Objective:**  
Download the dataset from Kaggle, perform initial data cleaning, and prepare the data for analysis.

**Tasks:**

- **Download & Setup:**  
  - Create a Kaggle account (if you don’t already have one).  
  - Download the Titanic dataset (train.csv and test.csv).  
  - Upload the dataset to your Jupyter Notebook environment or preferred IDE.

- **Initial Data Inspection:**  
  - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
  - Examine the dataset’s shape, data types, and summary statistics.
  - Identify missing values and outliers.

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**  
  - Handle missing data (e.g., imputation, removal, or flagging missing values).  
  - Convert categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numeric representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
  - Engineer additional features if applicable (e.g., family size, title extraction from names).  
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**Deliverable:**  
A Jupyter Notebook with code and commentary that documents your data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.

## Assignment 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:**  
Perform exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and the balance of the target variable (Survived).

**Tasks:**

- **Statistical Summary & Visualizations:**  
  - Generate summary statistics (mean, median, quartiles) for the numerical features.  
  - Create histograms, box plots, and density plots for key features (e.g., Age, Fare).  
  - Use bar charts or count plots to analyze the distribution of categorical features (e.g., Pclass, Sex).

- **Correlation & Relationship Analysis:**  
  - Create a correlation matrix (and a corresponding heatmap) to identify relationships between numerical features.  
  - Use pair plots or scatter plots to visualize relationships between key features and the target variable.

- **Insights:**  
  - Summarize your findings in text: What are the key characteristics of survivors vs. non-survivors? Which features appear most predictive?

**Deliverable:**  
A Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and a written summary of your EDA findings.

## Assignment 3: Decision Tree Modeling

**Objective:**  
Build a decision tree classifier using the preprocessed Titanic dataset and evaluate its performance.

**Tasks:**

- **Model Training:**  
  - Train a decision tree classifier on the training set using scikit-learn.  
  - Use appropriate model parameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) based on your initial experiments.

- **Evaluation:**  
  - Evaluate the classifier on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.  
  - Visualize the confusion matrix using Seaborn’s heatmap.

- **Feature Importance:**  
  - Extract and display the feature importances from your trained decision tree.  
  - Discuss which features are most influential in predicting survival.

**Deliverable:**  
A Jupyter Notebook section that documents model training, evaluation, and feature importance, with appropriate visualizations and commentary.

## Assignment 4: Hyperparameter Tuning and Advanced Visualizations

**Objective:**  
Optimize your decision tree model and visualize its decision boundaries using key features.

**Tasks:**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  - Use GridSearchCV (or a similar method) to search for the optimal decision tree parameters.  
  - Retrain your model using the best hyperparameters and evaluate its performance again.

- **Decision Boundary Visualization (Optional):**  
  - If your dataset’s features allow, select the top three most important features from your model.  
  - Retrain a decision tree on these features and plot the decision boundaries.  
    - For each pair among the top three features, create a 2D decision surface (fix the third feature at its mean value).  
    - If many features are categorical or if plotting is not feasible, consider using dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to obtain a 2D projection for decision boundary visualization.
  
- **Discussion:**  
  - Compare the performance of your tuned model with your initial model.  
  - Discuss the impact of hyperparameter tuning on overfitting, underfitting, and overall performance.

**Deliverable:**  
A Jupyter Notebook section that documents your hyperparameter tuning process, updated evaluation metrics, and (if applicable) decision boundary plots with explanations.

## Assignment 5: Final Report and Presentation

**Objective:**  
Synthesize your work into a comprehensive report and prepare a presentation for the class.

**Tasks:**

- **Report Preparation:**  
  - Prepare a jupyter notebook that covers:  
    - **Introduction:** Brief overview of the problem and dataset.  
    - **Data Preprocessing & EDA:** Summary of your data cleaning and exploratory analysis, including key insights.  
    - **Modeling & Evaluation:** Description of your decision tree model, hyperparameter tuning process, and evaluation results.  
    - **Feature Importance & Visualizations:** Discussion of which features were most important and any decision boundary visualizations or advanced plots.  
    - **Conclusion:** Overall findings, challenges encountered, and possible next steps.
