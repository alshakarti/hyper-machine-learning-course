# hyper-machine-learning-course

This repository houses my machine learning coursework in Jupyter Notebooks. Expect to find implementations and explorations of algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and basic neural networks, all powered by Python and libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
